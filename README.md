[In the future, everyone will be a software engineer and barely any will know how to code](https://qz.com/778380/the-future-is-software-engineers-who-cant-code/)

I chose this article because as as Wayne Gretzky famously said, *"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been."*
Coding is intimidating to many people, which is why there has been such a demand for people who can actually do it.  This article talks about how the future of programming is going to help supply meet demand.  Programs such as Microsoft Excel allowed for non technical people to be able to give computers logical instructions without the knowledge of coding.  **A market for no-code or low-code platforms is emerging**, allowing anyone to assemble software tools to solve business problems.  This allows for people to take on more creative and complex problems while not having to focus on the technical programming aspect. The article argues that there will always be a demand for software engineers, but the greatest path to success is the ability to use these resources to manage a team to create and design a product that satisfies the client.


##Comments
I agree with this article and do think that the world is driving in this direction. I think that elementary schools will start teaching programmng languages as well!
